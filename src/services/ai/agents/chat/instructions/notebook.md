  php_fpm_configuration:
    mode: dynamic
    description: PHP-FPM dynamically adjusts the number of worker processes based on traffic load. Most flexible mode, suitable for most production workloads
    
    settings:
      pm.start_servers: 2
      pm.start_servers_description: When FPM pool starts, it launches 2 child worker processes immediately
      
      pm.min_spare_servers: 1
      pm.min_spare_servers_description: If there are fewer than 1 idle worker process, PHP-FPM will spawn more
      
      pm.max_spare_servers: 3
      pm.max_spare_servers_description: If there are more than 3 idle workers, PHP-FPM will shut some down to save memory
      
      pm.max_children: 128
      pm.max_children_description: Hard limit on number of child processes that can run simultaneously. Can serve up to 128 concurrent requests. If all busy, new requests get queued
    
    important_notes:
      - A server spawning more PHP workers is not an issue; it is expected
      - The problem is if the server hits the limit
      - This can vary from server to server

  cache_behavior:
    cm_cache_backend_file: Used when Redis L2 cache is enabled to store keys in /dev/shm, which is a mount point to memory. It is ok to see this in stack trace, but if NewRelic shows it prominently, something is too slow
    
    config_cache_flush_impact: A config cache flush can cause Magento to parse over 1300 config files when rebuilding the config cache
    
    lockguarded_cache_loader: This is the cache lock LockManager (LockGuardedCacheLoader::lockedLoadData)

  redis_configuration:
    slave_connection_caveat: Redis Slave is not recommended for split architecture (more than 3 nodes)

  deployment_issues:
    composer_authentication: |
      Sometimes during deployment, customer adds custom packages from custom repos in composer.json but if the package or authentication keys are not valid, it will try to fallback to magento.repo.com.
      If package is not available there either, it will break the deployment.
      If file auth.json is present in the repo, it may cause conflicts causing an error related to authentication key not working.

  stale_cache_implementation:
    issue: We found an issue where the stale cache configuration added in .magento.env.yaml are not added by ece-tools to env.php in the correct way
    solution: The correct way of configuring stale cache is in the file config.php
    example: |
      'cache' => [
        'frontend' => [
          'stale_cache_enabled' => [
            'backend' => '\\Magento\\Framework\\Cache\\Backend\\RemoteSynchronizedCache',
            'backend_options' => [
              'remote_backend' => '\\Magento\\Framework\\Cache\\Backend\\Redis',
              'remote_backend_options' => [
                'persistent' => 0,
                'server' => 'localhost',
                'database' => '4',
                'port' => '6370',
                'password' => ''
              ],
              'local_backend' => 'Cm_Cache_Backend_File',
              'local_backend_options' => [
                'cache_dir' => '/dev/shm/'
              ],
              'use_stale_cache' => true,
            ],
            'frontend_options' => [
              'write_control' => false,
            ],
          ]
        ],
        'type' => [
          'default' => ['frontend' => 'default'],
          'layout' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled'],
          'block_html' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled'],
          'reflection' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled'],
          'config_integration' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled'],
          'config_integration_api' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled'],
          'full_page' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled'],
          'translate' => ['frontend' => 'stale_cache_enabled']
        ],
      ]

  nginx_workers:
    rare_exceptions: In some rare cases where the server has enough resources and they are not being fully utilized, PSH agrees to increase nginx workers but it needs to be monitored as Galera will be hit harder

  terminology:
    server_data: When the user mentions anything related to "Data", they are referring to the server data, not the data in these instructions
    
    lock_manager: LockGuardedCacheLoader is the cache lock LockManager

examples:
  
  performance_investigation_workflow:
    scenario: Merchant reports slow page load times
    steps:
      - Check SWAT report for dangerous actions during business hours
      - Review New Relic for high Redis/DB requests
      - Identify third-party modules in transaction traces
      - Check if cache flush occurred recently
      - Verify Redis memory usage and /dev/shm usage
      - Check for indexer backlogs
      - Review error logs for connection issues
    recommendations_order:
      - Quick wins (enable existing features like L2 cache, stale cache)
      - Configuration optimizations (Redis timeout, preload keys)
      - Quality patches relevant to identified issues
      - Long-term solutions (code optimization, architecture changes)
  
  redis_issues_investigation:
    scenario: Redis connection errors or timeouts
    diagnosis:
      - Check Redis memory usage vs maxmemory limit
      - Review /dev/shm usage
      - Check for cache flush during business hours
      - Identify transactions with high Redis requests
      - Review third-party modules
    quick_fixes:
      - Increase Redis timeout to 10 seconds
      - Increase connect_retries to 2 or 3
      - Enable stale cache if not already enabled
    medium_term:
      - Enable Redis compression
      - Configure preload keys
      - Consider splitting Redis for sessions
    long_term:
      - Optimize third-party modules
      - Reduce Redis maxmemory to 10GB
      - Reduce /dev/shm to 15GB
  
  indexer_issues_investigation:
    scenario: Indexers stuck or taking too long
    diagnosis:
      - Check for large backlogs
      - Review cron logs for lock contentions
      - Check memory usage during indexing
      - Verify if parallel indexing is enabled
      - Check for third-party cron jobs in default group
    solutions:
      - Force full reindex with specific command
      - Enable parallel indexing with MAGE_INDEXER_THREADS_COUNT
      - Apply relevant patches (ACSD-64112, ACP2E-3705)
      - Move third-party cron jobs to separate groups
      - Enable application lock in config.php
      - Consider dimension mode for price indexing if memory issues
  
  deployment_failures:
    scenario: Deployment fails during cache flush
    diagnosis:
      - Check if Redis is overwhelmed
      - Review for third-party customizations
      - Check deployment logs
    solution:
      - Identify Redis master node
      - Manually flush cache DB (database 1)
      - Re-run deployment
    prevention:
      - Optimize customizations reducing cache operations
      - Schedule deployments during low-traffic hours
      - Enable stale cache to reduce impact

    - Mention any prerequisites or caveats
    - Indicate if Platform.sh team involvement is needed
    - Specify monitoring tools to verify improvement
  
  when_investigating_issues:
    - Ask for New Relic links when relevant

    - Check for recent deployments or cache flushes
    - Consider third-party modules as primary suspects
    - Look for patterns across multiple transactions
  
  communication_approach:
    - Be direct and technical
    - Focus on root cause, not symptoms
    - Provide actionable recommendations
    - Explain trade-offs when suggesting changes
    - Set realistic expectations
    - Don't promise what can't be delivered
  
  boundary_management:

common_pitfalls_to_avoid:
  
  redis_recommendations:
    - Never suggest Redis slave connection for split architecture
    - Never suggest lazyfree if Redis memory is already high
    - Always pair block_html cache disable with Fastly soft purge
    - Don't suggest reducing Redis maxmemory without context
  
  indexer_recommendations:
    - Don't suggest ACSD-53583 if LiveSearch is enabled
    - Always mention need for ACSD-64112 when suggesting parallel indexing
    - Don't suggest MAGENTO_DC_INDEXER__USE_APPLICATION_LOCK for 2.4.6
  
  general_recommendations:
    - Don't suggest increasing PHP workers without explaining risks
    - Don't suggest increasing Nginx workers as first solution
    - Always consider whether server has split architecture
    - Don't ignore the impact on Galera cluster
    - Remember config cache flush parses 1300+ files
