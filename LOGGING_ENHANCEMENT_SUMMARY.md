# Enhanced Logging System for L0 Support

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive logging system enhancement implemented to improve debugging capabilities for SSH command failures and other operations in the L0 Support application.

## Problem Statement

The original logging system had several issues:
- **No debug.log or error.log files** - Logs were only created in production mode
- **Inconsistent logging** - Some areas had good logging, others didn't
- **No centralized log directory** - Logs were scattered
- **Missing detailed SSH error logging** - SSH failures weren't being logged properly
- **Poor debugging capabilities** - Difficult to troubleshoot SSH command failures

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logging Configuration (`src/config/logging.js`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Centralized log directory**: All logs now go to `Backend/logs/`
- **Multiple log files**: Separate files for different types of operations
- **Environment-aware logging**: Different log levels for different environments
- **Log rotation**: Automatic file rotation with size limits

**Log Files Created:**
- `error.log` - All error messages across the application
- `debug.log` - Debug information for development
- `combined.log` - All log messages combined
- `activity.log` - User activity tracking
- `ssh.log` - SSH-specific operations
- `magento.log` - Magento Cloud operations

### 2. Enhanced Logger Service (`src/services/logger.js`)

**Key Features:**
- **Specialized loggers**: Separate loggers for SSH, Magento Cloud, and general operations
- **Helper functions**: Easy-to-use logging functions with context
- **Metadata logging**: Rich context information for debugging
- **Sensitive data protection**: Automatic redaction of sensitive information

**Helper Functions:**
- `logSSHOperation(level, message, context)` - SSH-specific logging
- `logMagentoOperation(level, message, context)` - Magento Cloud logging
- `logActivity(message, context)` - User activity logging

### 3. Enhanced Magento Cloud Adapter (`src/adapters/magentoCloud.js`)

**Logging Improvements:**
- **Command execution tracking**: Detailed logging of all Magento Cloud commands
- **Error context**: Rich error information including stderr/stdout
- **Authentication tracking**: Specific logging for auth failures
- **Performance monitoring**: Execution time and output size tracking

**Example Log Output:**
```
2025-07-28T08:52:23.693Z [info]: Executing Magento Cloud command {"command":"ssh -p project123 -e staging","commandType":"ssh","projectId":"project123","environment":"staging","userId":"user123","hasApiToken":true}
2025-07-28T08:52:23.694Z [debug]: Command executed successfully {"commandType":"ssh","projectId":"project123","environment":"staging","hasOutput":true,"hasError":false,"outputLength":2048,"errorLength":0}
```

### 4. Enhanced SSH Commands (`src/api/app/sshCommands.js`)

**Logging Improvements:**
- **Command execution flow**: Step-by-step logging of SSH operations
- **Retry mechanism tracking**: Detailed logging of retry attempts
- **Error classification**: Specific error types (auth, timeout, etc.)
- **Node-level tracking**: Individual node execution logging
- **Performance metrics**: Success/failure rates and timing

**Example Log Output:**
```
2025-07-28T08:52:22.187Z [info]: Starting SSH command execution on node {"projectId":"project123","environment":"staging","nodeId":"web-1","commandCount":3,"commands":[{"id":1,"title":"Memory Usage"}],"userId":"user123"}
2025-07-28T08:52:22.188Z [debug]: SSH command execution completed {"projectId":"project123","environment":"staging","nodeId":"web-1","outputLength":1024,"stdoutLength":800,"stderrLength":224,"userId":"user123"}
2025-07-28T08:52:22.690Z [error]: SSH command execution failed on node {"projectId":"project123","environment":"staging","nodeId":"web-1","errorMessage":"Permission denied (publickey)","errorCode":"AUTH_FAILED","userId":"user123"}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Monitoring SSH Operations

```bash
# Monitor SSH operations in real-time
tail -f logs/ssh.log

# Monitor SSH errors specifically
tail -f logs/error.log | grep "SSH"

# Monitor all operations for a specific project
tail -f logs/combined.log | grep "project123"
```

### 2. Debugging SSH Failures

When SSH commands fail, you can now:

1. **Check SSH log**: `cat logs/ssh.log`
2. **Check error log**: `cat logs/error.log`
3. **Check Magento log**: `cat logs/magento.log`
4. **Monitor in real-time**: `tail -f logs/ssh.log`

### 3. Analyzing Performance

```bash
# Check success rates
grep "SSH command execution completed" logs/ssh.log | wc -l
grep "SSH command execution failed" logs/ssh.log | wc -l

# Check authentication issues
grep "AUTH_FAILED" logs/error.log

# Check timeout issues
grep "Connection timed out" logs/ssh.log
```

## Log Levels and Configuration

### Environment-Based Log Levels

- **Development**: `debug` level for maximum information
- **Production**: `info` level for performance
- **Test**: `warn` level for minimal output

### SSH-Specific Log Levels

- **Development**: `debug` level
- **Production**: `info` level
- **Test**: `debug` level

### Magento Cloud Log Levels

- **Development**: `debug` level
- **Production**: `info` level
- **Test**: `debug` level

## Security Features

### Sensitive Data Protection

The logging system automatically redacts sensitive information:
- API tokens
- Passwords
- SSH keys
- Session data
- Authentication tokens

### Example of Data Protection

```javascript
// Original data
{
  apiToken: "secret-token-123",
  password: "user-password",
  command: "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}

// Logged data
{
  apiToken: "[REDACTED]",
  password: "[REDACTED]",
  command: "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

## File Management

### Log Rotation

- **Max file size**: 10MB per log file
- **Max files**: 5 files per log type
- **Rotation**: Automatic when size limit is reached

### Log Directory Structure

```
Backend/logs/
├── activity.log      # User activity
├── combined.log      # All logs combined
├── debug.log         # Debug information
├── error.log         # All errors
├── magento.log       # Magento Cloud operations
└── ssh.log          # SSH operations
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Logs not appearing in files**
   - Check log level configuration
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check disk space

2. **Too much log output**
   - Adjust log levels in `src/config/logging.js`
   - Use environment variables to control verbosity

3. **Performance impact**
   - Logs are written asynchronously
   - File rotation prevents disk space issues
   - Sensitive data is redacted automatically

### Debugging SSH Failures

1. **Check SSH log first**: `cat logs/ssh.log`
2. **Look for error patterns**:
   - `AUTH_FAILED` - Authentication issues
   - `Connection timed out` - Network issues
   - `Permission denied` - SSH key issues
3. **Check Magento Cloud log**: `cat logs/magento.log`
4. **Monitor real-time**: `tail -f logs/ssh.log`

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Debugging
- **Detailed context**: Every operation includes rich metadata
- **Error classification**: Specific error types for easier troubleshooting
- **Performance tracking**: Execution times and success rates

### 2. Better Monitoring
- **Real-time visibility**: Monitor operations as they happen
- **Historical analysis**: Track patterns over time
- **Performance metrics**: Success rates and timing data

### 3. Enhanced Security
